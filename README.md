# Installer
CLI C# Remote Installer Application

The goal of Installer is to provide a consistant framework for Sys Admins to use for remote deployment tasks in their environment.

## Model
Installer treats all possible actions against your environment as an **Application**.

**Applications** are given **Jobs**

**Jobs** report **Results**

### Applications

**Applications** act as a directory with your *ApplicationDir*. Inside of the directory there will be serveral items:

- *running.lock* file generated by Installer to detonate application is in use, prevents some functions from completing
-  settings.ini file used to describe the Application Specific Attributes
- \Jobs folder used to store currently running Jobs
- \Results folder used to store Results from Jobs

### Jobs

**Jobs** act as the instructions to the **Applications**. **Jobs** can be anything from installing an application to 100 PC's to doing a basic file check against a few systems

### Results

**Results** are generated by the outcome of a **Job** event finishing. These can be configured per **Job** or inherited from the **Application** settings.

*Example:* A result can be setup to send an email each time Chrome succesfully installs on a target machine via your *Install Chrome* **Job** attached to your *Chrome* **Application**.

##Portability

Installer aims to be a single exe that can be ran by an administrator. Due to the model setup, Application | Jobs | Results should be easily shareable by the community.
